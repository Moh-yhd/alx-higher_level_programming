The "2-matrix_divided" module
=============================

Using "matrix_divided"
----------------------

First import "matrix_divided" from "2-matrix_divided" module:
	>>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

Now use it:
	matrix having integers as elements
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [0.33, 0.67, 1.0]]

	matrix having floats as elements
	>>> matrix = [[1.2, 2.8, 6.7], [8.1, 9.0, 5.56]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	[[0.6, 1.4, 3.35], [4.05, 4.5, 2.78]]

	matrix having integers and floats as elements
	>>> matrix = [[1, 1.5, 1.86], [2.1, 3, 4]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
	[[0.25, 0.38, 0.47], [0.53, 0.75, 1.0]]

	matrix having non float and non int element
	>>> matrix = [[4, 8, 'b'], [8, [3, 4], 7.2]]
	>>> matrix = matrix_divided(matrix, 5)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

	matrix having non equal length lists
	>>> matrix = [[4, 8, 7, 8], [8, 4, 7.2]]
	>>> matrix = matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

	div not float or int
	>>> matrix = [[4, 8, 8], [8, 4, 7.2]]
	>>> matrix = matrix_divided(matrix, 'd')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: div must be a number

	div is zero
	>>> matrix = [[4, 8, 8], [8, 4, 7.2]]
	>>> matrix = matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
